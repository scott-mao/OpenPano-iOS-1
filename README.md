# OpenPano-iOS

This project is transport from [OpenPano](https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/OpenPano)
Download and build with Xcode directlly

Then opencv stitch is much better than this opensource project
So I decide to open source for this project 
By this project maybe find the suluation of Scroll Capture Screen, good luck!

(Here I found a close-source project [Openpano-iOS](https://github.com/GitZChen/OpenPano-iOS))
